# ELEC 271: Digital Systems

VHDL Code for Labs done in a 2nd year [Digital Systems][elec-271] course at
Queen's University.

Also included are PDF files describing the labs and accessory files needed for
the code to work. Most of the code works on the Quartus software for Cyclone III
FPGA Chips. The topics covered in the lab include the basics of specifying
circuits leading up to the hierarchical design of a FSM controller on seven
segment displays.

Other topics covered in the course: boolean algebra applied to digital systems;
logic gates; combinational logic design; electronic circuits for logic gates;
arithmetic circuits; latches and flip-flops, registers and counters; synchronous
sequential logic and state machine design; implementation in programmable logic
chips.

> [!NOTE]
> The code for lab 1 is missing since I forgot to save the code on a USB drive.
